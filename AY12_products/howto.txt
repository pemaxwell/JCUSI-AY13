This python script sets up ip packet forwarding on the packbot using ip tables.
After changing the IPs below for the payload, packbot and ocu run this script on 
the packbot by using the command: python ipforward.py.
Once installed when the ocu sends tcp packets to the packbot and the port is between
50000 and 60000 the ip table will forward the tcp packets to the payload.
So from the point of the view of the ocu, the process on the payload
would seem like it was actually running on the packbot.
