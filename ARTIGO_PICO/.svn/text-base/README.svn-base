  ctrl+alt+del to restart and enter bios
  del to enter bios
  To boot from USB, from within BIOS set the following:
	General Idea: Tell it to boot from hard drive (should already be set this way). Then Tell it to boot from USB.
		1. Make sure the USB device is in one of the USB ports before powering up
		2. Get into the BIOS by hitting the ‘del’ button after powering up
		3. In the BIOS, select ‘Advanced’ and then ‘USB Configuration’
		4. In ‘USB Configuration’, select ‘USB Mass Storage Device Configuration’ (note:  this option will not be available if the USB device was not plugged into the USB port before powering up)
		5.In ‘USB Mass Storage Device Configuration’ for the USB device, select ‘Emulation Type’ -> ‘Hard Disk’  (this identifies in the BIOS that this device will be a hard disk emulation and can be a bootable device
		6. Hit the ‘Esc’ key twice and get to the top menu in the BIOS.  Open the ‘Boot’ menu.
		7. In the ‘Boot Settings’ window, select ‘Hard Disk Drives’
		8. In the ‘Hard Disk Drives’ menu, select the USB drive as the ‘1st Drive’ and the SATA drive as the ‘2nd Drive’
		9. Hit ‘Esc’ key once to get back to the ‘Boot Settings’ window
		10.In the ‘Boot Settings’ window select ‘Boot Device Priority’
		11.In the ‘Boot Device Priority’ window make the ‘1st Boot Device’ the USB hard drive and the ‘2nd Boot Device’ the SATA drive
		12.Hit F10 and save the configuration, the BIOS should reboot with the new settings and boot from the USB drive
		13.If booting in Ubuntu, you may have to use the text setup interface (not the graphical interface), I got into this by hitting the ‘del’ button once I saw the Ubuntu screen.


VIDEO DRIVER

  If you do not have the appropriate resolution then download video drivers from http://www.via.com.tw/en/support/drivers.jsp and http://www.openchrome.org/releases/. I downloaded via-xserver-86a50283.src.tgz and xf86-video-openchrome-0.2.904.tar.gz.  Note that the via-xserver was actually a bzip file so you have to use the tar -xvjf to untar/zip it (bzip should work also).  I am not sure if you need to use the openchrome driver. I built it but don't think I am using it.  Build and intstall the drivers using the READMEs inside the directories. You also may have to modify the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.  Use the example conf files in the folders as a guide.  Build/install DRM first, then XServer

  To Test Video drivers (sort of worked):
     ctrl/Alt/F2   (switch to tty2)
     login
     xinit -- :2
     If everything is right you should see a Grey desktop, and X for the mouse cursor and a term window. You can test glxinfo in the term if direct rendering is what you are working on. 

      Ctrl / Alt / Backspace to kill the Xwindow.
      Ctrl / Alt / F7 back to the Gnome Desktop
      Ctrl / Alt / F8 - If you didn't kill the Grey Xwindow you will find it again by hitting 

      Check the log to see what happened under /var/log/Xorg.2.log.

     OR try xnest (have to download it). xnest :1 -geometry 320x240 or gdmflexiserver --xnest

Useful Commands
	> modinfo via
	> lspci | grep VGA (determine video chipset).
  	> glxinfo | grep render -> direct rendering should be yes.
	> htop
	> xrandr --output default --mode 1280x720
